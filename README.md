# Classical-Cryptography

This repository contains Python implementations of classical ciphers used before the advent of modern computing, from techniques such as the Caesar cipher to the Hill cipher and Autokey cipher.

Each program is designed to highlight the cryptographic principles behind these methods. Please note that no emphasis has been placed on the practical utility of these ciphers for secure encryption, as they are all considered obsolete by the standards of modern cryptanalysis.
